# Gender Classifier

A Python web based dextop application that selects an existing audio file from the system and classifies it into male or female. It is made using keras and deployed using the FLASK framework.

## Getting Started

Before running the project,follow the following steps:<br><br>
1.Download " train-clean-100.tar.gz [6.3G]   (training set of 100 hours "clean" speech ) " data from http://www.openslr.org/12/<br><br>
2.Extract the data inside the "Gender_Classifier" folder and rename it to "LibriSpeechTrain"<br><br>
3.Download " test-clean.tar.gz [346M]   (test set, "clean" speech ) " data from http://www.openslr.org/12/<br><br>
4.Extract the data inside the "Gender_Classifier" folder and rename it to "LibriSpeechTest"<br><br>
5.Change the path to directories in directory_management.ipynb and run it.<br><br>
6.Run the Gender_Classifier_NN.ipynb to extract data,preprocess data, train model and store trained model.<br><br>

### Prerequisites
